// WavTrack Footer Integration Rules
// This file provides guidance for integrating the Footer component into the WavTrack app

// Footer Component Integration
// The Footer component is already integrated into the BaseLayout component
// It includes:
// - Social media links with Framer Motion animations
// - Feedback button
// - Copyright information
// - Scroll-to-top button that appears when scrolling down 100px

// Layout Structure
// The app uses a flex-col min-h-screen layout structure in BaseLayout.tsx
// This ensures the footer is positioned at the bottom of the page
// The main content area uses flex-1 to take up available space

// Responsive Design
// The Footer is responsive with appropriate padding and spacing
// Social icons scale on hover with smooth animations
// The scroll-to-top button is positioned at the bottom right

// Animation Guidelines
// Use Framer Motion for animations
// Apply consistent animation durations (0.2s for most transitions)
// Use scale animations for interactive elements (1.1 on hover, 0.95 on tap)

// Best Practices
// - Keep the Footer component lightweight to avoid performance issues
// - Ensure the scroll-to-top button doesn't overlap with other UI elements
// - Maintain consistent spacing between Footer sections
// - Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
// - Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate hover/focus states

// Optional Enhancements
// - Consider adding a "Back to Top" text label for better accessibility
// - Add more social media links as needed
// - Consider adding a newsletter signup form
// - Add links to Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, etc.
